:construction: REACT LEARNING APP :construction:

This is a repository that I made or I am doing during Udemy "Modern React with Redux" course.
I divide each section into branches:

- main: sample of comments section (basics of components interaction)
- seasons_app: understanding state and lifecycle methods
- pic_loading: getting images from Unsplash - handling inputs and making API request

To run app use:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
